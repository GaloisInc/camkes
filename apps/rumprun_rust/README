This application demonstrates a simple rust hello world program that runs in a 
rumprun unikernel instance on CAmkES on seL4. Second rumpkernel runs a simpe hello app.

If you get a  `No x86_64-rumprun-netbsd-gcc` error? You have to tell `cargo` where to look for those. They are compiled during the sel4 build process, but `cargo` doesn't know that. The easiest way is to add `export PATH="$PATH:/path_to_your_camkes_dir/build2/x86_64/rumprun/bin` to yout `.bashrc` file and then do `source ~/.bashrc`. Note that a relative path should work too.
